                <p>Take a step back in time on a century-old cable car and see the best 
                views of downtown Pittsburgh while riding one of the few remaining inclines 
                in the country. Opened on May 20, 1877, the Duquesne Incline was rescued and 
                restored by a group of local residents in 1963 and still delights residents 
                and visitors with its original, elegant, wooden cable cars. Now you can visit 
                the interior of the incline and watch the machinery while it operates. 
                The Duquesne Incline's upper station houses a museum of Pittsburgh history, 
                including photos and a storehouse of information on inclines from around the 
                world. Unusual Pittsburgh souvenirs, maps and photos can be found at the gift 
                shop.</p>

                <h2>1852</h2>
                <p>Old newspapers indicate the Duquesne Incline to have followed 
                very closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Residents referred 
                to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline" and located it on the present site of 
                The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station. Grandview Avenue was then the 
                High Street, and the area was just beginning to be converted from 
                farmland to homesites. This pleasantly-situated acreage was an 
                excellent area to absorb some of the expanding population of the 
                city, but the problem of easy access was still to be solved.</p>

                <h2>1877</h2>
                <p>The difficulties of financial banking were overcome and the 
                Incline was built and opened to the public May 20, 1877. The 
                Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh incline designed and 
                built by Samuel Diescher, for Kirk Bigham and Associates. 
                Mr. Diescher, an engineer, had become the country's foremost 
                builder of inclines. He was also to design and build most of 
                those that followed.</p>

                <p>At the time of its public opening, it was one of four 
                inclined planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later 
                came to be known as Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was 
                operated, from 1877 until 1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane 
                Company. </p>

                <p>The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights 
                Incline was formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount 
                Washington neighborhood group that had rescued, repaired, and 
                reopened the Incline in 1963. The purpose was to continue to 
                restore and rehabilitate the cars, equipment, and both stations, 
                and to establish the entire operation as a reliable commuter 
                facility and a popular visitor attraction.  Memberships in the
